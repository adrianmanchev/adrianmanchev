👋 Hi, I’m @adrianmanchev.

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a senior web developer, and I'd like to welcome you to my page. 
     I worked on many different internet projects. Node.js, Javascript, Vue.js, D3.js, PHP, Redis, MySQL, Github, trading bots and algorithms are some of my favorite tools. 
     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you want a developer.
     
📜 I’m currently learning python.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any javasript project.
